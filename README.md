Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

This project leverages machine learning to provide recommendations for optimal crops and fertilizers based on specific agricultural conditions. The system is designed to assist farmers and agronomists in making informed decisions to maximize crop yield and efficiency.

Key Features:

Crop Recommendation:
  Predicts the most suitable crops to grow based on input parameters such as soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.
  Utilizes a trained machine learning model to analyze the input data and provide crop recommendations.
  Outputs a list of recommended crops based on the input conditions.
  
Fertilizer Recommendation:
  Suggests the appropriate fertilizers needed for the specified crop based on similar input parameters along with the crop label.
  Employs a machine learning model to determine the best fertilizers to enhance crop growth and health.
  Outputs a list of recommended fertilizers for the given conditions.

Technologies Used:
  Machine Learning: LightGBM
  Backend: Node, Python
  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
  Database: MongoDB
  Payment Gateway: StripeAPI

This project aims to support precision agriculture by providing data-driven insights, helping to optimize resource use and improve crop production outcomes.
